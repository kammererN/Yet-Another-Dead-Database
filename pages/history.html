                <p>The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. The band is
                known for its eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, folk, country, jazz, bluegrass, blues, rock
                and roll, gospel, reggae, world music, and psychedelia; for live performances of lengthy instrumental
                jams that typically incorporated modal and tonal improvisation; and for its devoted fan base,
                known as "Deadheads". "Their music", writes Lenny Kaye, "touches on ground that most other groups don't
                even know exists." These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that
                made the Grateful Dead "the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world". The band was ranked 57th by
                Rolling Stone magazine in its "The Greatest Artists of All Time" issue. The band was inducted into the
                Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and a recording of their May 8, 1977 performance at Cornell
                University's Barton Hall was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012.
                Despite having only one top-40 single in their 30-year career, "Touch of Grey", the Grateful Dead remained
                among the highest grossing American touring acts for multiple decades and gained a committed fanbase by
                word of mouth and the exchange of live recordings due to the band's permissive stance on taping. </p>
                <p>The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s.
                The founding members were Jerry Garcia (lead guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (rhythm guitar, vocals), Ron
                "Pigpen" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums).
                Members of the Grateful Dead, originally known as the Warlocks, had played together in various Bay Area
                ensembles, including the traditional jug band Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. Lesh was the last
                member to join the Warlocks before they changed their name to the Grateful Dead; replacing Dana Morgan Jr.
                , who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and non-performing lyricist Robert Hunter
                joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971
                to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. The other official members
                of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968–1970), John Perry Barlow (non-performing lyricist;
                1971–1995), Keith Godchaux (keyboards, occasional vocals; 1971–1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals; 1972–1979),
                Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979–1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990–1995). Bruce
                Hornsby (accordion, piano, vocals) was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as a guest with the
                band on occasion before and after the tours. </p>
                <p> After the death of Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the
                Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. In 2015, the four surviving
                core members marked the band's 50th anniversary in a series of concerts that were billed as their last
                performances together. There have also been several spin-offs featuring one or more core members, such
                as Dead & Company, Furthur, the Rhythm Devils, Phil Lesh and Friends, RatDog, and Billy & the Kids.</p>
                <a href="#overview" title="To top"><h3 id="formation">1965 - 1966</h3></a>
                <p>The Grateful Dead began its career as the Warlocks, a group formed in early 1965 from the remnants
                    of a Palo Alto, California jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. The band's first
                    show was at Magoo's Pizza Parlor located at 639 Santa Cruz Avenue in suburban Menlo Park, on
                    May 5, 1965, now a Harvest furniture store. It continued playing bar shows, like Frenchy's
                    Bikini-A-Go-Go in Hayward and, importantly, five sets a night, five nights a week, for six weeks, at
                    the In Room in Belmont as the Warlocks, but quickly changed the band's name after finding out that a
                    different band known as the Warlocks had put out a record under the same name. (The Velvet
                    Underground also had to change its name from the Warlocks.) The first show under the name Grateful
                    Dead was in San Jose on December 4, 1965, at one of Ken Kesey's Acid Tests. Earlier demo tapes have
                    survived, but the first of over 2,000 concerts known to have been recorded by the band's fans was a
                    show at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco on January 8, 1966. Later that month, the Grateful
                    Dead played at the Trips Festival, a three-day psychedelic rock weekend party/event produced by Ken
                    Kesey, Stewart Brand, and Ramon Sender, that, in conjunction with the Merry Pranksters, brought
                    together the nascent hippie movement for the first time.</p>
                <p>The name "Grateful Dead" was chosen from a dictionary. According to Phil Lesh, "[Jerry Garcia] picked
                    up an old Britannica World Language Dictionary ... [and] ... In that silvery elf-voice he said to me,
                    'Hey, man, how about the Grateful Dead?'" The definition there was "the soul of a dead person, or
                    his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial". According
                    to Alan Trist, director of the Grateful Dead's music publisher company Ice Nine, Garcia found the
                    name in the Funk & Wagnalls Folklore Dictionary, when his finger landed on that phrase while playing
                    a game of Fictionary. In the Garcia biography Captain Trips, author Sandy Troy states that the band
                    was smoking the psychedelic DMT at the time. The term "grateful dead" appears in folktales from a
                    variety of cultures.</p>
                <p>Other supporting personnel who signed on early included Rock Scully, who heard of the band from Kesey
                    and signed on as manager after meeting them at the Big Beat Acid Test; Stewart Brand, "with his side
                    show of taped music and slides of Indian life, a multimedia presentation" at the Big Beat and then,
                    expanded, at the Trips Festival; and Owsley Stanley, the "Acid King" whose LSD supplied the tests and
                    who, in early 1966, became the band's financial backer, renting them a house on the fringes of Watts
                    (Los Angeles) and buying them sound equipment. "We were living solely off of Owsley's good graces at
                    that time. ... [His] trip was he wanted to design equipment for us, and we were going to have to be
                    in sort of a lab situation for him to do it", said Garcia.
                <a href="#overview"></a><h3 id="main_career">1967 - 1995</h3>
                <p>One of the group's earliest major performances in 1967 was the Mantra-Rock Dance—a musical event held
                    on January 29, 1967, at the Avalon Ballroom by the San Francisco Hare Krishna temple. The Grateful
                    Dead performed at the event along with the Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami, poet Allen
                    Ginsberg, bands Moby Grape and Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, donating
                    proceeds to the Krishna temple. The band's first LP, The Grateful Dead, was released on Warner
                    Brothers in 1967.</p>
                <p>Classically trained trumpeter Phil Lesh performed on bass guitar. Bob Weir, the youngest original
                    member of the group, played rhythm guitar. Ron "Pigpen" McKernan played keyboards, percussion, and
                    harmonica until shortly before his death in 1973 at the age of 27. Garcia, Weir, and McKernan shared
                    the lead vocal duties more or less equally; Lesh only sang a few leads, but his tenor was a key part
                    of the band's three-part vocal harmonies. Bill Kreutzmann played drums, and in September 1967 was
                    joined by a second drummer, New York City native Mickey Hart, who also played a wide variety of other
                    percussion instruments.</p>
                <p>1970 included tour dates in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the band performed at The Warehouse for two
                    nights. On January 31, 1970, the local police raided their hotel on Bourbon Street, and arrested and
                    charged a total of 19 people with possession of various drugs. The second night's concert was
                    performed as scheduled after bail was posted. Eventually, the charges were dismissed, except those
                    against sound engineer Owsley Stanley, who was already facing charges in California for manufacturing
                    LSD. This event was later memorialized in the lyrics of the song "Truckin'", a single from American
                    Beauty which reached number 64 on the charts. </p>
                <p>Mickey Hart took time off from the Grateful Dead beginning in February 1971, owing to his father, an
                    accountant, having absconded with the band's money, leaving Kreutzmann once again as the sole
                    percussionist. Hart rejoined the Grateful Dead for good in October 1974. Tom "TC" Constanten was
                    added as a second keyboardist from 1968 to 1970, to help Pigpen keep up with an increasingly
                    psychedelic sound, while Pigpen transitioned more into playing various percussion instruments and sang. </p>
                <p>After Constanten's departure, Pigpen reclaimed his position as sole keyboardist. Less than two years
                    later, in late 1971, Pigpen was joined by another keyboardist, Keith Godchaux, who played grand
                    piano alongside Pigpen's Hammond B-3 organ. In early 1972, Keith's wife, Donna Jean Godchaux,
                    joined the Grateful Dead as a backing vocalist.</p>
                <p>Following the Grateful Dead's "Europe '72" tour, Pigpen's health had deteriorated to the point that
                    he could no longer tour with the band. His final concert appearance was June 17, 1972, at the
                    Hollywood Bowl, in Los Angeles; he died on March 8, 1973 of complications from liver damage.</p>
                <p>The death of Pigpen did not slow the band down, and it continued with its new members. With the help
                    of their manager Ron Rakow, they soon formed their own record label, Grateful Dead Records. Later
                    that year, they released their next studio album, the jazz-influenced Wake of the Flood. It became
                    their biggest commercial success thus far. Meanwhile, capitalizing on Flood's success, the band soon
                    went back to the studio, and the next year, 1974, released another album, From the Mars Hotel. Not
                    long after that album's release however, the Dead decided to take a hiatus from live touring. Before
                    embarking on the hiatus, the band performed a series of five concerts at the Winterland Ballroom in
                    San Francisco in October 1974. The concerts were filmed, and Garcia compiled the footage into The
                    Grateful Dead Movie, a feature-length concert film that would be released in 1977.</p>
                <p>In September 1975, the Dead released their eighth studio album, Blues for Allah. They resumed touring
                    in June 1976. That same year, they signed with Arista Records. Their new contract soon produced
                    Terrapin Station in 1977. The band's tour in the spring of that year is held in high regard by their
                    fans, and their concert of May 8 at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York is often considered to be
                    one of the best performances of their career.</p>
                <p>Keith and Donna Jean Godchaux left the band in February 1979. </p>
                <p>Following the departure of the Godchauxs, Brent Mydland joined as keyboardist and vocalist and was
                    considered "the perfect fit". The Godchauxs then formed the Heart of Gold Band before Keith died
                    in a car accident in 1980. Mydland was the keyboardist for the Grateful Dead for 11 years until his
                    death by narcotics overdose in July 1990, becoming the third keyboardist to die. </p>
                <p>Shortly after Mydland found his place in the early 1980s, Garcia's health began to decline. His drug
                    habits caused him to lose his liveliness on stage. After beginning to curtail his opiate usag in
                    1985 gradually, Garcia slipped into a diabetic coma for several days in July 1986. After he
                    recovered, the band released In the Dark in July 1987, which became their best selling studio album
                    and produced their only top-40 single, "Touch of Grey". Also that year, the group toured with Bob
                    Dylan, as heard on the album <a href="../pages/albums.html/#dyl_and_dead">Dylan & the Dead.</a></p>
                <p>Mydland died after the summer tour in 1990 and Vince Welnick, former keyboardist for the Tubes,
                    joined as a band member, while Bruce Hornsby, who had a successful career with his band the Range,
                    joined as a touring member. Both performed on keyboards and vocals—Welnick until the band's end, and
                    Hornsby mainly from 1990 to 1992. The Grateful Dead performed their final concert on July 9, 1995 at
                    Soldier Field in Chicago.</p>
                <p>Jerry Garcia died on August 9, 1995. A few months after Garcia's death, the remaining members of the
                    Grateful Dead decided to disband. Since that time, there have been a number of reunions by the
                    surviving members involving various combinations of musicians. Additionally, the former members have
                    also begun or continued individual projects. </p>
                <p>In 1998, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, along with several other musicians, formed a band
                    called the Other Ones, and performed a number of concerts that year, releasing a live album, The
                    Strange Remain, the following year. In 2000, the Other Ones toured again, this time with Kreutzmann
                    but without Lesh. After taking another year off, the band toured again in 2002 with Lesh. That year,
                    the Other Ones then included all four living former Grateful Dead members who had been in the band
                    for most or all of its history. At different times the shifting lineup of the Other Ones also
                    included guitarists Mark Karan, Steve Kimock, and Jimmy Herring, keyboardists Bruce Hornsby, Jeff
                    Chimenti, and Rob Barraco, saxophonist Dave Ellis, drummer John Molo, bassist Alphonso Johnson, and
                    vocalist Susan Tedeschi.</p>
                <p>In 2003, the Other Ones, still including Weir, Lesh, Hart, and Kreutzmann, changed their name to the
                    Dead. The Dead toured the United States in 2003, 2004 and 2009. The band's lineups included
                    Jimmy Herring and Warren Haynes on guitar, Jeff Chimenti and Rob Barraco on keyboards, and Joan
                    Osborne on vocals. In 2008, members of the Dead played two concerts, called "Deadheads for
                    Obama" and "Change Rocks". </p>
                <p>Following the 2009 Dead tour, Lesh and Weir formed the band Furthur, which debuted in September 2009.
                    Joining Lesh and Weir in Furthur were John Kadlecik (guitar), Jeff Chimenti (keyboards), Joe
                    Russo (drums), Jay Lane (drums), Sunshine Becker (vocals), and Zoe Ellis (vocals). Lane and Ellis
                    left the band in 2010, and vocalist Jeff Pehrson joined later that year. Furthur disbanded in 2014.
                </p>
                <p>In 2010, Hart and Kreutzmann re-formed the Rhythm Devils, and played a summer concert tour. </p>
                <p>Since 1995, the former members of the Grateful Dead have also pursued solo music careers. Both Bob
                    Weir & RatDog and Phil Lesh and Friends have performed many concerts and released
                    several albums. Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann have also each released a few albums. Hart has
                    toured with his world music percussion ensemble Planet Drum as well as the Mickey Hart Band.
                    Kreutzmann has led several different bands, including BK3, 7 Walkers (with Papa Mali), and
                    Billy & the Kids. Donna Godchaux has returned to the music scene, with the Donna Jean Godchaux
                    Band, and Tom Constanten also continues to write and perform music. All of these groups
                    continue to play Grateful Dead music. </p>
                <p>In October 2014, it was announced that Martin Scorsese would produce a documentary film about the
                    Grateful Dead, to be directed by Amir Bar-Lev. David Lemieux supervised the musical selection, and
                    Weir, Hart, Kreutzmann, and Lesh agreed to new interviews for the film. Bar-Lev's four-hour
                    documentary, titled Long Strange Trip, was released in 2017.[</p>
                <a href="#overview" title="To top"><h4 id="fare_well">Fare Thee Well</h4></a>
                <p>In 2015, Weir, Lesh, Kreutzmann, and Hart reunited for five concerts called "Fare Thee Well:
                    Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead". The shows were performed on June 27 and 28 at Levi's
                    Stadium in Santa Clara, California, and on July 3, 4 and 5 at Soldier Field in Chicago. The
                    band stated that this would be the final time that Weir, Lesh, Hart, and Kreutzmann would perform
                    together. They were joined by Trey Anastasio of Phish on guitar, Jeff Chimenti on keyboards, and
                    Bruce Hornsby on piano. Demand for tickets was very high. The concerts were simulcast
                    via various media. The Chicago shows have been released as a box set of CDs and DVDs. </p>

                <p>In the fall of 2015, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann and Bob Weir joined with guitarist John Mayer,
                    keyboardist Jeff Chimenti, and bassist Oteil Burbridge to tour in a band called Dead & Company.
                    Mayer recounts that in 2011 he was listening to Pandora and happened upon the Grateful Dead song
                    "Althea", and that soon Grateful Dead music was all he would listen to. The band played six
                    tours: October–December 2015, June–July 2016, May–July 2017., May–August 2018, and
                    May–July 2019. On October–November 2019 they played 6 dates on the "2019 Fall Fun Run".
                    On December 27 and 28, they played at The Forum in Inglewood (Los Angeles), California as part of
                    their "2019 New Year's Run" tour. On December 30 and 31, they played in their hometown of San
                    Francisco at the Chase Center, featuring a bi-plane that descended from the ceiling of the Chase
                    Center carrying the daughters of Jerry Garcia, Trixie Garcia and her half-sister, Ken Kesey's
                    daughter Sunshine Kesey, dropping rose petals on the audience as they toured the arena.</p>
                <p>Barlow died in 2018 and Hunter in 2019. </p>
                <p>In 2022, John Mayer announced that Dead & Company's summer 2023 tour will be their last. </p>
