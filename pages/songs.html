            <p>The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. The band is
                known for its eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, folk, country, jazz, bluegrass,
                blues, rock and roll, gospel, reggae, world music, and psychedelia; for live performances of
                lengthy instrumental jams that typically incorporated modal and tonal improvisation; and for its
                devoted fan base, known as "Deadheads". "Their music", writes Lenny Kaye, "touches on ground
                that most other groups don't even know exists." These various influences were distilled into a
                diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead "the pioneering Godfathers of the jam
                band world".</p>
